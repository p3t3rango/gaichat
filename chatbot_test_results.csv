Timestamp Notes allow users to leave precise feedback on specific moments in audio and video files. Anyone with the shareable link can view the file and add timestamp comments, even without a gämi account.

The Home Screen Modules provide quick access to frequently used collaboration-related features like Pinned Chats, Shared files, and Community Folders. These customizable widgets enable easy coordination between team members.

The Community Folders feature creates shared workspaces where multiple users can access, contribute, and manage files with controlled permissions. Members can collaborate in real-time and utilize features like Timestamp Notes within the shared folders.

The Communication Features include encrypted text messaging, voice notes, voice calls, and video calls, allowing seamless collaboration and file sharing within conversations.

This covers the key collaboration capabilities described in the gämi documentation. Let me know if you have any other questions!","collaboration","PASS",N,

Time Stamp Notes: Allows users to leave precise feedback on specific moments in audio and video files, accessible to both gämi users and non-gämi users through shareable links.

Community Folders: Collaborative shared workspaces that allow multiple users to access, contribute to, and manage files within a unified folder structure with controlled permissions and real-time collaboration features.

The documentation does not mention any other collaboration features. If the user has a question about collaboration features not covered here, I cannot provide a response, as that would not relate to the information in the gämi documentation.","collaboration","PASS",N,
